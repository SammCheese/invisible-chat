# Invisible Chat

Encrypt your Messages with the power of Stegcloak

## Install

1. Go to "Releases"
2. Download the file "dev.sammcheese.InvisibleChat.asar"
3. Move the file to your plugin folder

## Usage

Right now, you have to use the shortcut (CTRL + J) to toggle Encryption.

Once toggled, you need to send a message in this format:

```
this is the cover message *this will be hidden*
```

Decryption works by pressing the (currently) Transparent button in the Minipopover

Encrypted messages look like ðŸ”’thisðŸ”’

## Credits

None of this would have been possible without [0x41c](https://github.com/0x41c)
