# Invisible Chat

This is a message encrypter for [Powercord](https://github.com/powercord-org/powercord "Powercord Website")

## Install Me

If you're using Replugged, simply click [here](https://replugged.dev/install?url=SammCheese/invisible-chat)

or run this in your plugin folder

```console
git clone https://github.com/SammCheese/invisible-chat
```


## How I work

### Inline Encryption

Usage:

```txt
This is the Cover Message #!The Message you want to Hide!# #?password?#
```

### GUI Explanation

```txt
The Lock Icon in the Chatbar can be used to open a GUI to Encrypt Messages.

The "Secret Message" Textbox will be the Text you want to hide.
The "Message Cover" Textbox will be the Text Visible for Others. (Must be more than one word)
The "Encryption Password" Textbox will be the Password the other person needs to use to Decrypt your Encrypted Message

You can set Userspecific Passwords in your Plugin Settings which then can be Selected in the Encryption GUI.
