- [x] Injection for MessageContent for decryption and embeds
- [ ] Key store configurable per channel or optionally, global
- [ ] BetterQuoter like zwc encrypted message creator
- [ ] Optional auto decryption that starts by checking global keys, then if none worked add a context for temporary keys
- [ ] Lock button state appearances \[Disabled, Disabled (No Key), Enabled, Enabled (No Key)]

- [ ] Tap the lock after compose to copy

## A note

 I will not be working on this plugin 24-7. This plugin is priority to the extent that I can still have time to work on other ones. Becuase of that, I highly encourage and appreciate your help in making this plugin possible and hope to see it grow into a must have in your powercord setups!
